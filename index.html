<h1> How to Install a PHP Web Based Appication </h1>
<p>Now don't worry, at the beggining of the semester I didn't know what a PHP was either. A PHP is a CMS system like Joomla and WordPress. Today I will be explain how to install WordPress through Amazon Lightsail. </p>
</div>
<div class="p-3 mb-2 text-dark p-3 mt-3 mb-3 rounded-3">
<h1>Create a Lightsail account</h1>
<p><ul>
<li> The first step to this process is to go to lightsail.awa.amazon.com and create an account for yourself.</li>
<li>Once you create your account you are going to want to create an instance</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<div class="p-3 mb-2 text-dark p-3 mt-3 mb-3 rounded-3">
  <h1>Creating an instance</h1>
  <p>This is where you start to build your instance and hopefully get it up and running</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Click the create an instance button</li>
    <li>When brought to the screen with the instances: click and make sure your data region is correct</li>
    <li>Next you will want to select the platform Linus/Unix</li>
    <li>Then you will choose the WordPress instance. Choosing the WordPress blueprint will set up WordPress for you and you won't have to go through the steps of setting it up manually.</li>
    <li>Now, you do hae to pay for lightsail. It's amazon, nothing is free! Choose the cheatest option which is $3.50 a month with the first month free.</li>
    <li>The last part of the instance building is identifying your instance. You want to make sure you choose a unique name for your instance but make it something recognizable.</li>
    <li>Click create instance!</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="p-3 mb-2 text-dark p-3 mt-3 mb-3 rounded-3">
  <h1>Accessing WordPress</h1>
  <p>Now, here is where it can get slightly confusing. Stay with me now.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Click on your WordPress Instance</li>
    <li>To find what your username and password is, you will want to click connect using SSH for your password, and your username will be below (called Bitnami) along with your public IP.</li>
    <li>Once you open the large black screen that says bitnami with all the code on the page, you will want to type in this exact code to retrieve your password</li>
  </ul>
